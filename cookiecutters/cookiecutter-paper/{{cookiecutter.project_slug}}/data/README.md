# The `data/` directory

Data should exclusively be stored in the following formats

- Small, tabular data files: `CSV` format. Use comment lines starting with `#`
  (at the beginning of the file) to describe the contents and all parameters
  that were used to produce de data.
- Larger, tabular data files: `HDF5` format. Use metadata to describe the
  contents and all parameters that were used to produce the data.
- Medium-size, structured data: `JSON`.
